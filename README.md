# Numerical-methods-project
I wanted to create program with small amount of data in it to mathematically calculate GPA (or average points) of pre-added students of different groups and ages.
To make it I first of all, created list of adequate amount of students (for me it's 5), then I added a few digits of info about them and "marks", 
by marks I mean their point of every subject that they studied. Then after creating list of data of each student, I created a function that projects students data
and calculates it, through loops.
